This is what differentiates them: Listening to Farmers First,High-Quality Seeds That Make a Difference and Making Seeds Accessible & Affordable
  
     b.4. outcomes & impact 
     East-West Seed is not only about selling seeds but about empowering smallholder farmers and transforming communities. It goes as far as showing the impact these farmers make day-to-day by growing more, earning more, and living a lot better.

c. case study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation
    
     c.1. company overview (Reason for implementing the enterprise system)
   East-West Seed, founded by Simon N. Groot, a Dutch seedsman, and Benito Domingo, a Filipino seed trader, in 1982, is a global tropical vegetable seeds company. It aims to transform the livelihoods of smallholder farmers through high-quality seed production and innovative services. East-West Seed is headquartered in Nonthaburi, Thailand, and operates in more than 60 countries around the globe, almost 20 million farmers served and in close to 1300 cities."""

To realize operational efficiencies and manage end-to-end visibility on the entire farming life cycle, sowing to harvest, East-West Seed established an enterprise system throughout six Asian countries: Indonesia, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam. The move aimed to tackle a number of issues: 

Decreasing reliance on expensive and tedious manual data capture.

Preventing data loss and ensuring data integrity.

Real-time visibility into field staff activities. 

Establishing accurate performance measurement models for each seed variety. 

Agrochemical inputs used by farmers.

Seed performance tracking along the value chain.

East-West Seed hoped to use this enterprise system to convert the way the company operated into precision farming and facilitate sustainable agriculture practices across its areas.

     c.2. implementation process & challenges
     According to the enterprise system put in place by East-West Seed, it would improve operational efficiency and visibility from sowing to harvest. East-West partnered with Cropin on the deployment of Cropin Grow (SmartFarm) in six Asian countries, including Indonesia, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam. 

Deployment of Cropin Grow (SmartFarm): Every process will start from sowing up to harvest, with remote monitoring and tracking enabled. Field activities will be viewed-to ensure complete view during the time from sowing to harvest.

Collection and Visibility of Information: This ensured offline economic data collection, providing visibility into seed varieties and operations in the fields. Safe production with traceability of input resources.

Farmer Engagement and Predictive Analytics: A multilingual secure support system was created to involve farmers. It provided a model for accurate output predictability drawn from historical data, satellite imagery, weather data, AI/ML, and big data.

Challenges Presented by the Introduction: During the implementation process, East-West Seed faced a number of incremental challenges: Costly and Cumbrous Manual Mode of Data Capture: It had a very high cost as well as inefficiencies because before adopting any system, data collection was manual.

Loss of Data: Compromised Decision Making and Operation Efficiency. Data Loss due to Manual Process: This manual way of doing things produces data loss, which would subsequently affect decisions and operational efficiency.

Lack Visibility into Field Staff Activities: Limited insight into the activities of field staff has hindered effective and beneficial management and support. 

Methods Missing Accurate Performance Evalution for Each Seed Variety: Methods were lacking within the company to accurately evaluate the performance of each seed variety, adversely affecting product development and farmer recommendation procedures.

Challenges in Monitoring of Usage of Agrochemicals: Monitoring of the quantity of agrochemicals used
    
     c.3. Key failure factors
     Heights have been reinvented in East-West Seed, with addressing most operational challenges proactively implementing an enterprise system, primarily to enhance visibility and efficiency. No specific "failure factors" have been acknowledged publicly, though East-West Seed made the following findings and addressed quite a number of points:
Manual Data Capture: Data captures from the pre-implementation stage were manual and exposed inefficiencies and errors, as well as compromised validity.
Loss of Data: Increased risk of data loss that could affect decision-making was introduced by the dependence on manual processes.
Limited Visibility into the Activities of Field Staff: There was no real-time visibility into the activities of the field staff, which rendered management ineffective.
Performance Evaluation Gaps: Most seed variety performance could not be accurately measured, affecting product development and recommendation.
Monitoring of Agrochemical Use Problems: Agrochemicals used by farmers were so hard to monitor in quantity that concern could arise on sustainability and compliance issues.
Tracking Seed Performance to Quality: Seed performance tracking along the whole value chain becomes inconsistent and affects quality control and discontent of customers.
Identifying these challenges that East-West Seed has taken into its initiatives in changing operations towards precision farming and sustainable agricultural practices on all watersheds.
    
     c.4. outcomes & consequences
     Here are the good results of using Cropin Grow (SmartFarm) platform has led to significant positive outcomes:by East-West Seed:
Enabling Improved Operational Efficiency. More than 24000 acres of seed production farmland digitized and streamlined processes, decreasing manual entry and minimizing errors.

Data Accuracy and Real-time Insights: Field staff have access to real-time data, allowing proactive monitoring and timely intervention, leading to improved production accuracy.

Increased Farmer Engagement and Productivity: At least 20000 of the more than 30000 farmers trained through projects like THRIVE have been inducted into the adoption and development of improved practices that eventually increase productivity and income.

Promotion of Sustainable Agriculture: Rainfed areas under this initiative "Smart Farming, Healthy Food" have expanded to 15375-hectare farmlands by benefiting 25000 smallholder farmers, of whom 65% are women. 

These outcomes are a reflection of the mission of East-West Seed in using technology and knowledge transfer to improve agricultural practices, smallholder farmer support, and sustainable farming.
